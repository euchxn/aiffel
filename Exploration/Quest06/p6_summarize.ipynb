      "In 1999, in an unnamed city, Computer programmer Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is secretly a hacker known as \"Neo\". He is restless, eager and driven to learn the meaning of cryptic references to the \"Matrix\" appearing on his computer. A woman named Trinity is observing Neo, and she does so knowing that Morpheus believes that Neo is \"the One\".\n",

      "During one of her forays, Trinity is tracked down by the local police to her hotel room. Outside the hotel a car drives up and three agents appear in neatly pressed black suits. They are Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), Agent Brown (Paul Goddard), and Agent Jones (Robert Taylor). Trinity calls Morpheus and says that her line was tracked and Morpheus orders her to find another exit. Trinity easily defeats the six policemen sent to apprehend her, using fighting and evasion techniques that seem to defy gravity.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fierce rooftop chase ensues with Trinity and an Agent leaping impossibly from one building to the next, astonishing the policemen left behind. Trinity makes a daring leap across an alley and through a small window. Trinity makes it to a public phone booth on the street level. The phone begins to ring. As she approaches it a garbage truck, driven by Agent Smith, careens towards the phone booth. Trinity makes a desperate dash to the phone, picking it up just moments before the truck smashes the booth into a brick wall. The three Agents find no body in the wreckage. \"She got out,\" one says. The other says, \"The informant is real.\" \"\n"
